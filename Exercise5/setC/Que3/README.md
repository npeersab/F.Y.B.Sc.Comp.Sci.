The temperature of a city varies according to seasons. There are four seasons - spring, summer, Monsoon and winter. The temperature ranges are: Spring (15-25 degrees), Summer (25-40 degrees), Monsoon (20-35 degrees), Winter (5-20 degrees). Accept weekly temperatures (12 weeks per season) for each season, check if they are in the correct range and calculate the average temperature for each season
